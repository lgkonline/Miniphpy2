## Okay, what is Miniphpy?

Miniphpy is a small tool for web developers to minify JavaScript and CSS files
for their projects.

How you could guess, Miniphpy is a PHP app which runs on your PC.


## Combine your JS files

There are already tools like Koala which let you compile LESS/Sass and also minify CSS and JS files.
But I couldn' find a good way to combine JS files.

And that's why I started Miniphpy.


## Why the "2"?

Miniphpy2 works a little bit different then the older Miniphpy.
Instead of setting the inputs and outputs inside of Miniphpy, the config will be set in your HTML file.

If you prefer to use the older Miniphpy, please go to https://github.com/lgkonline/miniphpy.
